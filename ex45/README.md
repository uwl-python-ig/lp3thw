# EXERCISE 45

## Instructions
Here are the basics of this exercise, from [the book](https://orbiscascade-washington.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01ALLIANCE_UW/1juclfo/alma99323947822201451).

> 1. Make a different game from the one I made[\*\*](#notes)
> 2. Use more than one file, and use `import` to use them. Make sure you know what that is. 
> 3. Use *one class per room* and give the classes names that fit their purposes (like `GoldRoom`, `KoiPondRoom`).
> 4. Your runner will need to know about these rooms, so make a class that runs them and knows about them. There're plenty of ways to do this, but consider having each room return what room is next or setting a variable of what room is next.
