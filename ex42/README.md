I found the RealPython article [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python 3](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) pretty helpful. I ended up taking some notes in [bmr_oop_tutorial.py](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/lp3thw/blob/master/ex42/bmr_oop_tutorial.py) ("notes" = some explanations of concepts that I found helpful and copied).
For example, I found perhaps the first clear-ish and concise explanation of "dot notation" under [this heading](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/#class-and-instance-attributes).
