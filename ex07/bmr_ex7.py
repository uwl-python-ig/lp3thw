# When I remove it, the following line of code (beginning with end7) prints on a new line,

# As best I can see, all end= ' ' should do is insert a space

# Prints the vars in order, no space in between because no space is included in the print args
# until the last line.
# But aha! Here now perhaps I see 'end' having an actual function as a--what?
# An argument of the print function? SEE BELOW

    # By default python’s print() function ends with a newline.
    # A programmer with C/C++ background may wonder how to print without newline.
    # Python’s print() function comes with a parameter called ‘end’.
    # By default, the value of this parameter is ‘\n’, i.e. the new line character.
    # You can end a print statement with any character/string using this parameter.
