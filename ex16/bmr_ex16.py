# Okay, according to pydoc3 documentation, this is the sys module's argv object
    # (The usage of 'object' in pydoc description of sys is a little funny to me--
    # isn't this really more of a tool/function/etc. than an 'object'?)
from sys import argv

# The first command-line argument will be the var script, the second will be the var filename
    # I *think* that "argument" is the correct term here
script, filename = argv

# Pretty straightforward here with one line that uses a format string
print(f"We're going to erase {filename}.")
print("If you don't want that, hit CTRL-C (^C).")
print("If you do want that, hit RETURN.")

# Now this is a little tricksy. If CTRL+C is entered, the script stops due to something that I believe was called
    # a 'keyboard interrupt' in the error message
    # But the tricksy thing is that, really, would *any other* input allow the script to continue?
    # I mean, it doesn't necessarily have to be only RETURN, right?
    # Just any input that doesn't stop the script, like the CTRL+C. I'm going to try a random alpha-numeric input and see.
        # Yes. Random alpha-numeric allowed the script to continue
input("?")

# HEre we get three pieces of keyboard input and turn into strings
    # What would happen if one or more of these were integers?

    # We take *this* (which has been 'captured in' [?] 'put into' [?]), and then we *do something to it*
    # The thing that I think I'm getting is that we do something by providing the var, then a period, then
    # the function(s) to use on the thing that the var is...
    # Does this make sense?
