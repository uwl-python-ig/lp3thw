Some [UWL Python IG](https://github.com/uwl-python-ig) members are working through [Learn Python 3 the Hard Way](https://alliance-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/l9c4fq/CP71290856150001451) and sharing work here.
## Naming and sharing files
- There is (or will be) a directory for each exercise in the book; store your files for a given exercise in a corresponding directory
- Add your initials, or some other distinguishing string, to your filenames to avoid overwriting someone else's work
## How to contribute
- We went through some [basic git and GitHub stuff](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/meetings/blob/main/2021_02_11.md#basic-git-and-github-stuff) at our 2021-02-11 meeting, and worked through getting set up to contribute using a command-line interface
- There are plenty of options for using a graphical user interface as well, including [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and the [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) Git GUI tool
## What to contribute
- Share your solutions to the exercises and study drills, especially if you've commented on your code, tried doing things a bit differently, or written some other code to help make sense of things
- Did you take notes on an exercise? Create a README file in the directory for that exercise to share them, or add your notes to an existing README (like [this one](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/lp3thw/blob/master/ex37/README.md), for example)
- Stumped? Create [an issue](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/lp3thw/issues); someone might be able to help, or you may just be able to remember to come back to the place you got stuck later
