# EXERCISE 37
Another study-on-your own exercise. Here are some resources that may be helpful:
* Programiz > Python Programming > [List of Keywords in Python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list)
* Real Python > [Python Keywords: An Introduction](https://realpython.com/python-keywords/)
## Some more things, perhaps to return to later...
**...because there is a lot in the keywords list,** and one can't take it in all at once
* [Python Global, Local and Nonlocal variables](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/global-local-nonlocal-variables): From [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/); referenced because the [`global` keyword](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/global-keyword) is in the list, but it seems that to understand this one really needs to understand the bigger picture...
* [Python import: Advanced Techniques and Tips](https://realpython.com/python-import/): From [Real Python](https://realpython.com/); both `import` and `from` are on the list here, but there is much to know in relation to these about [modules](https://realpython.com/python-import/#modules), [packages](https://realpython.com/python-import/#packages), the difference between them, etc., etc.
* [Python while Loop](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/while-loop)
* [The with statement](https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement) from [The Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/index.html) > [Compound statements](https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/compound_stmts.html#compound-statements): *Many of the other keywords from ex37's list are here as well,*
