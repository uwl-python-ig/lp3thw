# BMR notes
Is one of those exercises that doesn't involve writing a script, it just requires you to use the Python interpreter to evaluate a bunch of Boolean expressions, like this...
```
$ python3
Python 3.6.9 (default, Jul 17 2020, 12:50:27)
[GCC 8.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> True and True
True
>>> False and True
False
>>> 1 == 1 and 2 ==1
False
>>>
```
