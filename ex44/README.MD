- How come I've never just read the [Python tutorial on classes](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/classes.html) (link for Python 3.8 version)?
- Built-in Functions--Python 3.8.13 documentation - [super()](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html#super)
- Here's a Programiz tutorial on [Python Inheritance](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/inheritance) - these are usually pretty nice and visually appealing tutorials
