## Reading More Code
> You are now to [...] read even more code, [...] do the following:
>   1. For each class give its name and what other classes it inherits from.
>   2. Under that, list every function it has and the parameters they take.
>   3. List all of the attributes it uses on its self.
>   4. For each attribute, give the class this attribute is.

  - rdflib > [rdflib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/tree/master/rdflib) > [graph.py](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib/blob/master/rdflib/graph.py)
  - I'll comment this up in [bmr_comments_graph.py](https://github.com/uw-libraries-python-interest-group/lp3thw/blob/master/ex41/bmr_comments_graph.py)
