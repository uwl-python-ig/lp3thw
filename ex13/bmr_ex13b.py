# Okay here's what I don't get about this:
# var 'one' is doing double duty right!?
# Because it must be entered so that the printing will happen as we've defined *in it*
# But it is *also* the value of the first variable, and gets printed as such
# Thus, 'double-duty,' as I'm calling it
# How to run the script, but separate the input of the script name as an argument from the input of
    # three variables for printing??
